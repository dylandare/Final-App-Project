    <p>
      A stunning shot taken by one of our best photographers, this piece
      features extensive knowledge of what makes an image look great. The
      creative usage of the white lines on the bridge as leading lines guide the
      eye along the image towards the bright lights. The rule of thirds is also
      carefully applied here, with the brightest lights in the top right corner
      of the image. The beautiful contrast between the bright lights and dark
      night sky also improves the quality of the image by leaps and bounds.
